# Building the Linux kernel source

In this chapter we will go in depth on how to build the Linux kernel source. This is a very important step in the process
of learning how to develop for the Linux kernel that is why we will spend a lot of time on it. If you are already
familiar with the process of building the Linux kernel, feel free to skip this chapter.

This chapter is divided into the following sections:

- [How to get the Linux kernel source code](./getting-source-tree.md)
- [Preparing the host machine to build the Linux kernel]()
- [How to configure the Linux kernel in order to build it]()
- [Building the Linux kernel]()
- [Installing the Linux kernel]()
